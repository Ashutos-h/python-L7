1- What is Time Tuple?

import datetime
 dt = datetime.date(2016, 10, 12)
 dt.timetuple()
time.struct_time(tm_year=2016, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=12, tm_hour=0, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=292, tm_isdst=-1)
>>> tuple(d.timetuple())
(2012, 10, 18, 0, 0, 0, 3, 292, -1)

Python tuples are made of nine numbers:

Index	Field		Domain of Values
0	Year 		(4 digits)	Ex.- 1995
1	Month		1 to 12
2	Day		1 to 31
3	Hour		0 to 23
4	Minute		0 to 59
5	Second		0 to 61 (60/61 are leap seconds)
6	Day of Week	0 to 6 (Monday to Sunday)
7	Day of Year	1 to 366 (Julian day)
8	DST		-1,0,1

Leap seconds are added to make up to Earth’s slowing rotation. When DST is 0, it isn’t applied. When it’s 1, it is applied. However, when it is -1, it is up to the library to determine that.



2- Write a program to get formatted time.

import time;
localtime=time.asctime(time.localtime())
print(localtime)


3- Extract month from the time.

import datetime
dt=datetime.date.today()
m=dt.month
print(m)

4- Extract day from the time.

import datetime
dt=datetime.date.today()
dd=dt.strftime("%A")
print(dd)


5- Extract date (ex : 11 in 11/01/2021) from the time.

import datetime
dt=datetime.date.today()
da=d.day
print(da)

6- Write a program to print time using localtime method.

import time
localtim=time.asctime(time.localtime())
print(localtim)


7- Find the factorial of a number input by user using math package functions.

import math as m
num=int(input("Enter a number to find factorial of: "))
print("Factorial of {} = {}".format(num,m.factorial(num)))




8- Find the GCD of a number input by user using math package functions. 

import math as m;
num1=int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2=int(input("Enter first number: "))
print("GCD of {} and {}  = {}".format(num1,num2,m.gcd(num1,num2)))



9- Use OS package and do the following tasks: 
1. Get current working directory.
2. Get the user environment.

import os
print(os.getcwd())
print(os.path.abspath('.'))
